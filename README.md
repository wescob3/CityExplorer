# CityExplorer
Group Project

City Explorer is an app developed in android that allows its users to interact with maps in a very different and entertaining way. As a new user a person must create an account. Once this is set up, the user will be made available with a set of different options which include Adding friends, Viewing scores, Interacting with the Map and deleting accounts.
Users experience a blend of in-person and online content with this application, they can walk with their live location being tracked and they can also view the street views as represented above which gives a rich immersive experience. It not only provides a fun reason for a motivation to move out and explore (in order to collect more of Dragon Points), also educates the users more about the surroundings with the zeal of exploring the Google Maps API embedded views. With all the options available and combined in an application, it serves as a good exploration aid for the players.
